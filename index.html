        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of
             programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js, Python, C++ and Fortran.
              It is based on the Electron framework, which is used to develop Node.js Web applications that
               run on the Blink layout engine.</p>
               <p> The most common use for consoles is to troubleshoot the system or applications.
                 If an app crashes regularly, for example, examining the log files generated by the
                  app in Console will reveal what the app was doing just before the crash.</p>
